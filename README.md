This repository contains a library of functions that can be used to process WorldView-2 and -3 satellite imagery. The library is intended to be used for mapping submerged aquatic vegitation with WorldView imagery, but it could be easily adapted for other applications and other sensors. There are functions for radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, clipping, masking, and mosaiccing the imagery. There are also functions to define and train a deep convolutional neural network (dcnn) and use it to classify an image.
